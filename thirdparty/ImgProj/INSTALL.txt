PREREQUISITES
=============
The following software must be installed on the system:
- some C++ compiler suite
- png++ (http://www.nongnu.org/pngpp/) or (sudo apt-get install libpng++-dev)
- boost (the development packages)
- boost_algorithm
- boost_filesystem
- boost_regex


COMPILATION: Linux
==================
In case you have CMake installed, the following two commands should generate a static library:
  cmake .
  make
If you do not have CMake, you have to generate your own Makefile

COMPILATION: Windows
====================
I did not try this, but in theory CMake can generate a VisualStudio project file, which should then compile.
